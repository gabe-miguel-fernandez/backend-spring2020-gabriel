TO DO LIST SPECIFICATIONS

OVERVIEW

My "To Do List" project is influenced by the Microsoft To Do app (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-to-do-list-app) and the traditional yellow writing pad with horizontal lines. I like how the Microsoft To Do app has a plain UI that displays a simple list of tasks. I also like the simplicity of jotting down a "to do" task on a writing pad and then checking it off when it's done. 

APPEARANCE

This application's single web page uses web-safe, sans-serif fonts, Arial and Helvetica, to minimize compatibility issues across computers. The color palette consists of black, grays, yellows and whites. On the webpage, yellows indicate that the text is read-only or not editable in the given context such as a task's text or creation date. Black and shades of white indicate an element is active or editable, e.g., a clickable button or an editable text field. Grays indicate that an element is inactive, such as a disabled button, or placeholder text that needs to be replaced when editing an existing note.

APPEARANCE > LAYOUT

The "To Do List" application is a simple, one-page design that is divided into five different sections: 
(1) A title bar that contains buttons to display tasks according to their status, e.g., all, incomplete/not done, and complete/done.
(2) A message box that displays informational messages about any task that was modified or added.
(3) A "new note" section where a user can enter text for a new note.
(4) A task list that contains existing tasks depending upon how the user wants to filter those tasks.
(5) An "edit note" section where a user can modify an existing note's text.

FEATURES

This application provides five basic features or actions: (1) Display or list notes; (2) Add or create a note; (3) Change a note's status to complete; (4) Update a note; and (5) Delete a note. A message box displays information messages after a task is added, completed, updated or deleted.

FEATURES > DISPLAY TASK LIST

The top section on the web page is a black bar that displays application's name and three buttons, "All," "Not Done," and "Done," that display tasks with the corresponding status. A count of the corresponding tasks found appears at the top of the task list.



FEATURES > MESSAGE BOX

Below the top section on the web page is the message box that displays a scrollable list of information messages generated after adding, completing, updating or deleting a task.

FEATURES > ADD NEW TASK

The "Add task" section appears below the message box. This section contains a textbox for a new task's text, and two buttons, one to create a new task (labelled "Add New Note") and the other to cancel the action (labelled "Cancel Adding Note"). The textbox contains grayed text instructing the user to enter text for a new note there. Once the user clicks inside the textbox, those instructions are removed, and the textbox appears empty. If the user presses the "Cancel Adding Note" button, the "Add task" section is restored to its original state, where the textbox displays the grayed instructions. The message box is not changed since no new task was created. If the user enters text in the textbox, that new text appears in black, and then if the "Add New Note" button is clicked, a new note appears in the list of notes, a record of that action is added to the message box and the "Add task" section is reset to its original state.

FEATURES > TASK 

In the task list, a task is displayed inside a box divided into three sections: (1) buttons, (2) the note's text, and (3) the date and time when the task was created along with its status ("Completed" or "Incomplete"). Each task has three buttons: (1) "Done", (2) "Edit", and (3) "Delete."  Pressing the "Done" button marks the current task as completed, and the task is updated to show only completed tasks. Pressing the "Edit" button displays the "Edit Task" section for that task. Pressing the "Delete" button deletes the current task, and the task list now displays the current list of incomplete tasks. A completed task's "Done" and "Edit" buttons are disabled (i.e., they appear grayed out and inactive). "Delete" is only action available for a completed task which cannot be changed back to incomplete, and its text cannot be modified.

FEATURES > MARK TASK AS COMPLETED

In the task list, an incomplete task has an active "Done" button in the box containing that task. When a user click that task's "Done" button, that action is recorded in the message box, the task now has its status = "Completed" and th task list is updated to show only "Completed" tasks including the one just marked "Completed."

FEATURES > UPDATE TASK

In the task list, an incomplete task has an active "Edit" button in the box containing that task. When a user clicks that task's "Edit" button, the "Add Task" and task list sections are replaced by the "Edit Task" section.  The textbox contains grayed text instructing the user to enter new text for the existing note there. Once the user clicks inside the textbox, those instructions are removed, and the textbox appears empty. If the user presses the "Cancel Change" button, the "Edit task" section is resplaced with the "Add Note" section and the task list displaying incomplete tasks. The message box displays a record of the cancelled editing task action. If the user enters text in the textbox, that new text appears in black. If the "Save Change" button is pressed, the modified note appears in the list of incomplete notes, a record of that action is added to the message box and the "Add task" section is reset to its original state, and the task list displays incomplete tasks.

FEATURES > DELETE TASK

In the task list, a task has an active "Delete" button in the box containing that task. When a user click that task's "Delete" button, that action is recorded in the message box the task list is updated to show only "incompleted" tasks. The deleted task will no longer appear in any task list.
