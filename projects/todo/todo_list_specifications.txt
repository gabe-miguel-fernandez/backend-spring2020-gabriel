TO DO LIST SPECIFICATIONS

OVERVIEW

My "To Do List" project is influenced by the Microsoft To Do app (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-to-do-list-app) and the traditional yellow writing pad with horizontal lines. I like how the Microsoft To Do app has a plain UI that displays a simple list of tasks. I also like the simplicity of jotting down a "to do" task on a writing pad and then checking it off when it's done.
