TO DO LIST SPECIFICATIONS

OVERVIEW

My "To Do List" project is influenced by the Microsoft To Do app (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-to-do-list-app) and the traditional yellow writing pad with horizontal lines. I like how the Microsoft To Do app has a plain UI that displays a simple list of tasks. I also like the simplicity of jotting down a "to do" task on a writing pad and then checking it off when it's done. 

APPEARANCE

The "To Do List" page has a simple design that is divided into five different sections: 
(1) A title bar that contains buttons to display tasks according to their status, e.g., "Incomplete," "Complete," or "All."
(2) A message box that displays informational messages about any task that was modified or added.
(3) A "new note" section where a user can enter text for a new note.
(4) A task list that contains existing tasks depending upon how the user wants to filter those tasks.
(5) An "edit note" section where a user can modify an existing note's text.
